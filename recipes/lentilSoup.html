        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>
            Lentil Soup can come in many varieties. My favorite kind is this one, which is boasting with zesty Italian 
            flavors and lots of fresh vegetables! It tastes a lot like minestrone, but with the addition of protein-rich 
            lentils. In other words, itâ€™s 100% satisfying!

        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>

            <li>Vegetable Broth</li>
            <li>Canned Diced Tomatoes</li>

        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and onions and saute 2 minutes then add garlic and saute 2 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Pour in vegetable broth and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Add in lentils, basil, oregano, thyme and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add in zucchini and kale and simmer 10 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice and add up to 1 cup of water to thin as needed (as the soup rests the lentils soak up more of the broth).</li>
