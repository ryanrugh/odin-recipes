    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>
        These addictive seasoned "fries" from Mark Bittman are actually baked, but we promise you won't miss the grease. 
        The spice mix – garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper – can be used on regular potatoes as well 
        (you'll just need to increase the baking time a bit).
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 400.</li>
        <li>Cut the sweet potatoes into sticks 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide and 3 inches long, and toss them with the oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl, and toss them with the sweet potatoes. Spread them out on 2 rimmed baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake until brown and crisp on the bottom, about 15 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
